## STEP 1: Preparing a MetaMask Wallet (Polygon Network)

To work on the Polygon network, you will need a wallet configured for this network.

### 1.1 Adding the Polygon network (if not already added)

1. Open **MetaMask**.
2. Click on the network drop-down menu (usually "Ethereum Mainnet").
3. Click **"Add Network"**. 4. Select "Custom Network" and enter the following information:
* Network Name: Polygon Mainnet
* New RPC URL: https://polygon-rpc.com/ (or https://rpc-mainnet.matic.network)
* Chain ID: 137
* Currency Symbol: MATIC
* Block Explorer URL: https://polygonscan.com/
5. Click "Save." Your wallet is now on the Polygon network.

### 1.2 Adding the UAH DAO Token

To see your UAH DAO balance, add the token manually:

1. Make sure you are on the Polygon Mainnet in MetaMask. 2. At the bottom of the assets page, click "Import Tokens."
3. Go to the "Custom Token" tab and enter:
* **Token Contract Address:** `[0xe8d15560f5ff9C0039283877c0809Aec4A5826aB]`
* **Token Symbol:** UAH (should be filled in automatically)
* **Decimals:** 18 (should be filled in automatically)
4. Click "Import."

## STEP 2: Creating a Liquidity Pool (LP)

We will use the general steps that apply to most DEXs on Polygon (QuickSwap, Uniswap V3, SushiSwap).

1. **Go to the DEX:** Open your chosen decentralized exchange (e.g., QuickSwap) and go to the **"Pool"** or **"Liquidity"** section.
2. **Connect a Wallet:** Connect your **MetaMask** (make sure the Polygon network is selected).
3. **Select a Pair:** Click **"Add Liquidity"**. Select a pair:
* **Token 1:** UAH (insert contract address if not found: 0xe8d15560f5ff9c0039283877c0809Aec4A5826aB )
* **Token 2:** MATIC or USDC (stable asset)
4. **Enter Amount:** Enter an amount equivalent to **minimum $10 USD**.
* *Example: If you want to create a pool in any $10 trading pair, you need to deposit $10 in MATIC (or USDC).*
5. **Approve:** You will need to **approve** each token to be used by your wallet (two transactions) and pay a small fee in MATIC. 6. Create a Pool (Supply): Once approved, click "Create Pool" or "Supply/Confirm."

## STEP 3: Receiving the Affiliate Reward

**To receive the 1000 UAH DAO reward, you must confirm your participation.**

1. Sending Confirmation (Airdrop Trigger):**
* Go to your MetaMask wallet.
* Send exactly 1 UAH DAO to the following UAH DAO Contract address on the Polygon network:
`[0x12A3dE2375C0330ef3aaDf6Bb6c02A7D9c8a319C]`
* **Important:** This transaction (sending 1 UAH) serves as your unique confirmation of participation in the affiliate program.
2. **Verification:** Our automated script will verify that your address (the one that sent 1 UAH) is indeed a liquidity provider.
3. **Reward:** After verification, **1000 UAH DAO** will be sent to your wallet from the official rewards address.
